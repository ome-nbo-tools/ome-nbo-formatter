Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 25:181; Shannon C.E., (1949) Proc. IRE, 37:10). The Nyquist Criterion determines the minimal Sampling Density needed to capture ALL information from the Specimen into the Image. It can be shown that if the Sampling Density is higher than the Nyquist Rate (also referred to as Critical Sampling Distance) all information about the object is captured. It is important to note that the Nyquist Rate depends on the Objective Numerical Aperture (NA) and on the Excitation and Emission WaveLengths.

NOTE: In the case of Point Detectors the value of Analog Gain can be set freely by the user. Conversely, in the case of Cameras, it is common for the Gain to be preset by the Manufacturer to minimize noise. In this case, either the Analog Gain cannot be changed or the user is given the choice of selecting between a few preset Analog Gains values upon Acquisition. Finally, several Cameras might have so-called Automatic Gain Control (AGC or AutoGain) that will automatically adjusts so the full range of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.
